Aknowledgements:

Mattia Serra acknowledges Alireza Hajighasem, Mohammad Farazmand and George Haller for the development of this software. 

Algorithm:

This code implements theoretical results developed by Serra & Haller (2016) [1] at ETH Zurich. 
Specifically, the code developed here can be used to compute attracting Objsctive Eulerian Coherent Structures also called Transient Attracting Profiles (TRAPS)[2].
